# CS-405-Secure-Coding

This repository demonstrates the secure coding practices I implemented for a mock company called Green Pace. The specifics of the project are best detailed in the PowerPoint presentation within the repository, but in short include unit tests, defense in depth strategies, coding standards, and encryption policies. Overall, this project allowed me to fully understand the importance of security when it comes to technology, as well as how to best implement it.
